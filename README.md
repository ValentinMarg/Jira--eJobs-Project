[eJobs Test Plan](https://github.com/ValentinMarg/Test/blob/main/eJobs%20project.docx)


1. Introduction 

 

   eJobs is the largest online recruitment platform in Romania, with a database of over 4 million CVs. It was created from the desire to modernize classic recruitment methods and facilitate the employee-employer relationship. 

    As the app is still under development, this version will have limited features. Over a period, new ones will appear. 

    The online recruitment platform eJobs.ro addresses both consumers (in this case candidates looking for jobs) and companies (organizations looking to hire). Any candidate can register on eJobs.ro for free. Also here, on the site, you can create a CV, get career advice and a professional counseling hotline. 

1.1 Project Objective 

 

   The main objective for us is to raise the trust in the quality of the project as high as possible, finding the problems but also preventing them. All of this must be met before releasing it to the customer. 

â€¢ Application web site: https://www.ejobs.ro/  


 

1.2 Functionalities in scope 

 

   On the EJOBS website we will ensure that all the features in the requirements will be tested using the following types of testing: smoke testing, functional testing, usability testing, portability testing, localization testing, acceptance testing, validation testing, verification testing and security testing. 

   We will also perform a static test using the static analysis on the documentation to ensure that there are no contradictions, and that the user guide is clearly defined. 

   The eJobs application also, will be tested on the latest versions of: Chrome, IE and Microsoft Edge browsers, Opera and Mozilla.
