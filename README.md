[eJobs Test Plan](https://github.com/ValentinMarg/Test/blob/main/eJobs%20project.docx)


1. Introduction 

 

   eJobs is the largest online recruitment platform in Romania, with a database of over 4 million CVs. It was created from the desire to modernize classic recruitment methods and facilitate the employee-employer relationship. 

    As the app is still under development, this version will have limited features. Over a period, new ones will appear. 

    The online recruitment platform eJobs.ro addresses both consumers (in this case candidates looking for jobs) and companies (organizations looking to hire). Any candidate can register on eJobs.ro for free. Also here, on the site, you can create a CV, get career advice and a professional counseling hotline. 

1.1 Project Objective 

 

   The main objective for us is to raise the trust in the quality of the project as high as possible, finding the problems but also preventing them. All of this must be met before releasing it to the customer. 

• Application web site: [Click here!](https://www.ejobs.ro/)  


 

1.2 Functionalities in scope 

 

   On the EJOBS website we will ensure that all the features in the requirements will be tested using the following types of testing: smoke testing, functional testing, usability testing, portability testing, localization testing, acceptance testing, validation testing, verification testing and security testing. 

   We will also perform a static test using the static analysis on the documentation to ensure that there are no contradictions, and that the user guide is clearly defined. 

   The eJobs application also, will be tested on the latest versions of: Chrome, IE and Microsoft Edge browsers, Opera and Mozilla.  



   1.3 Functionalities and tests out of scope  

 

   - Automation testing is beyond the scope of this project. 

   - Non-functional testing like stress, load, maintainability, spike, reliability and performance is beyond scope. 

   - Recovering testing and compliance testing is beyond scope. 

   - The mobile application will not be tested.

2. Test process 

2.1 Test planning  

   • Roles and responsibilities: 

|Marginean Valentin- QA Junior       |Will test: functional testing, compatibility testing, Gui testing |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|QA Senior                           |  Will test:                                                      |





• Entry criteria: 


   - Functional business specifications are defined 

   - Roles and responsibilities are allocated 

   - The project risks are identified 

 

• Exit criteria: 

   - 100% of tests are executed s 

   - 90% of tests are passed 

   - regression test was ended successfully 

   - no Critical defects have open status



• Project Risks: 

   - personal deficit
     
   - unclear documentation
     
   - unfinished test environment

• Product Risks: 

   - IE browser might have performance issues  

   - new browser might not be supported 

   - stability risks may appear (crashes, disconnects) 

   - stress conditions might impact the web application 

   - new browser might not be supported 

 

2.2 Test analysis 

   - we received and understood the business requirements, and we have all the details for creating the test conditions 

   - we will test: candidate log in, interface display, compatibility of the application, creating a CV . 

   - we plan on running a full regression test on the current version 

   - we suggest a compliance regulation testing and a full regression test on the current version



2.3 Test design 

   - all the test cases are written and reviewed 

   - all test cases are created in Jira as test management tool 

 

2.4 Test implementation 

   -esting environment is up and running

   -smoke test passed

   - all the test data is available and reviewed (user as candidate role/company role, mail, password, the data for creating a CV by the user as a candidate) 

   - this test run includes only regression testing in which we will run tests that have the highest priority 

   - create the test suites (Cycle Summary) 




2.5 Test execution 

   - the test will be executed on the latest versions of browsers: Mozilla, IE and Microsoft Edge, Chrome and Opera 

   - bugs will be created based on the failed test cases 

   - the full regression testing will be done after new application changes 

   - retesting will be done after a bug fix 

 

2.6 Test closure 

   - 100% of tests are executed 

   - 90% of tests are passed 

   - no Critical defects have Open status 

   - Exit criteria are all succeed 


 

2.7 Test monitoring and control 

   - status reports will be generated to reflect the current status of testing process 

   - in case of major problems, control measures will be taken  

   - efficiency and quality are improved in accordance with the requirements 

   - periodic reporting through status reports
