1. Introduction 

 

     eJobs is the largest online recruitment platform in Romania, with a database of over 4 million CVs. It was created from the desire to modernize classic recruitment methods and facilitate the employee-employer relationship. 

    As the app is still under development, this version will have limited features. Over a period, new ones will appear. 

    The online recruitment platform eJobs.ro addresses both consumers (in this case candidates looking for jobs) and companies (organizations looking to hire). Any candidate can register on eJobs.ro for free. Also here, on the site, you can create a CV, get career advice and a professional counseling hotline.
